# Zoom to GIF

The implementation is based on a Stack Overflow answer by Mark Setchell <sup>[1]</sup>.

Sometimes I am bored. And boredom results in stuff like this.

## Instructions
* Use ack-nicholson.gif from assets. In the future you can use any other gif. ![ack-nicholson](assets/images/ack-nicholson.gif)
* Install imagemagick (linux).
* Run the following command: ./zoom.sh -f ack-nicholson.gif -z 20 -x 200 -y 200 -t 3
* Observe!

## Results
![ack-nicholson](assets/images/anim.gif)
![ack-nicholson](assets/images/result.gif)
![ack-nicholson](assets/images/result1.gif)
![ack-nicholson](assets/images/result2.gif)
![ack-nicholson](assets/images/result3.gif)
![ack-nicholson](assets/images/result4.gif)
